            <p>
                Cytoscape.js is a powerful open-source JavaScript library used for visualizing and analyzing graph-based data.
                It allows developers to create interactive, customizable, and scalable network visualizations in web applications.
                The library is part of the larger Cytoscape ecosystem, which includes the Cytoscape desktop application for bioinformatics and other graph-related analyses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built on modern web technologies, Cytoscape.js supports dynamic graph manipulation, animations, user interactions, and various layout algorithms.
                It is widely used in fields like bioinformatics, social network analysis, and data visualization.
